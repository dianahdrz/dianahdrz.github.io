Greetings to all, my name is Diana Hernandez and I am majoring in computer scientist in CSUF. I am planing on graduating in 2027. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


- Lab 2 part-1: Strings;
On lab 2, I was able to comprehend the basics and the introduction of how "cout" and "cin" functions in programming. For this fact, I was able to utilize it more confidently knowing how they actually work. To add on I also found it very interesting and fun how your able to assign the computer to ask a person what to input into the device in order for the system programmed to work. 

- Lab 6 part-1: Sandwich;
For lab 6, it was one of my favorites because it related a little bit about food. More so, I learned about string and how it's used in different context. Since string is a data type is used to represent text rather than numbers. Therefore, since this lab contains text involved such as "protein", "condiment", and bread" it is necessary for the string data. To also receive the expected input for this programming. 

- Lab 7 part-1: Parking Rules;
In this particular lab, I enjoyed working on it because I got a better understanding into how the if's and the else if's work. As well as getting to know how the bool tool is being used which is something that is utilized in so many ways with just two easy words of being true or false. Especially since after lab 6 and 7, I noticed how many programming is used in the everyday life without notice, in this case it would be the what if's.
